            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <opener>HUMBLY SHEWETH,</opener>
               <p>THat whereas many and sore Grievances have long lain on the Estates and Consciences of your poor Petitioners, and notwithstanding all our Groanings and Complainings in all humble sort under the same, many of the remain unredress'd to this day: And the Lord ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, as we hope, by those various dispensations which have past on these poor Nations of late years, prepared your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours for a more clear and candid carrying on the Publike Work in your hands, whom he at first exercised and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in contesting with, and bringing down those Powers which greatly obstructed the Publike Weal of these Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the Christian Liberties of the Lords people there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: And you being now (as we are perswaded by the good hand of God, which we cannot but acknowledge to his praise) after some years unhappie diversion from a Free State to a Single Person, unexpectedly restored to the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful capacitie of Ruling these Nations, and administring thereto, in all wise, equal and just sort; We are again en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged humbly to present unto and petition as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The matter of Tythes, so long complained of, we finde by sad experience, is still a heavie and unequal Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then upon us, on a double account: 1. As it is an oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45616:3"/> to us in our Estates, to pay the Tenth of our labour, cost, and increase of our Land: which also (we judge) is no small discouragement to the improvement of Lands, and one occasion, (as we humbly conceive) of the Dearth and Scarcity of Grain in this Nation. 2. We finde this exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Tythes from us as aforesaid, to be a Soul-oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which we esteem the greatest of all; it being as we conceive, in its original, either Jewish, or Popish, or both; and so contrary to the Gospel Rule by which we ought to walk.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That we are constrained to pay to the Repairing and Upholding of the publike Meeting-houses in this Nation, (commonly called by the name of Churches) though not permitted our selves to meet in them at such times when no other do make use of them: which charge we judge the more unequal, because we are necessitated in many places to purchase, hire and build Meeting places for our selves, at our own costs and charges.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That we still observe the corrupt, fraudulent, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thensom, vexatious, expensive and delatory proceedings at Law remaining, both as they respect the keeping or gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our just Rights; arising, as we conceive, very much from the numerous Volumes, and intricate Interpretations thereof; and that which should be for a Cure, oftentimes in both proves equally as bad, if not worse then the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease: Yet hitherto have found no relief, but our Burthens thereby rather increased; giving men of corrupt mindes, and contentious dispositions, great advantage against us. And we humbly conceive, that in some criminal cases, the Punishments inflicted are very unequal to the Offences.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That though we have many of us adventured Person and Estate equally with others, to purchase our Liberties, and have been publikely assured to have equal Liberty with other judged godly in the Nation; yet have we been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently molested and disturbed in the peaceable practice of our Profession, Preaching, and holding forth the Gospel of peace to poor sinners; our persons seized on and imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and some of us sometimes otherwise abused in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of our duties to the Lord.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:45616:3"/>
               <p>The premises considered, we humbly pray,</p>
               <p>That as those who are differently minded in matters of Worship, are not required nor desired to pay to our Ministers, we may not be constrained to pay to the maintenance of theirs: but we humbly crave, that this Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of Tythes may be removed, it being burthensom to our consciences.</p>
               <p>And for the Publike Meeting-houses be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, we humbly beg we may be wholly discharged from being compelled to bear any part of the charge about the repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of such places, unless we may have the liberty to make use of them.</p>
               <p>And as to the Law, our humble Desire is, That the Laws of the Land may be (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your Wisdoms) made, contracted and explained, and put in such a way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, as may be most suitable to a Free Commonwealth: And that what Overtures have been already made, or hereafter may be further tendred from any person of known integrity and ability, may be received and considered by you, in order to that end: And that the same may become the more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, we humbly pray, that such persons may be appointed to the exercise of all places of Trust and Judicature, as are men fearing God and hating covetousness, and known as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertors of the common Liberties of the good people of this Commonwealth, in their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and religious concernments.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:45616:4"/>
               <p>That some publike Edict or Law may be enacted, for giving Protection to us, with all other Godly in the Nation, though of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering apprehensions about the things of God in matters of Worship, protecting us in our Persons, Liberties and Estates, in the peaceable preaching &amp; practising the truths we profess, from the violence and injury of any; whereby we may be encouraged to walk in all ways of godliness and honesty under such protection.</p>
               <p>Finally, It is our humble and earnest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, That you take very great heed of that dangerous Rock on which many have split themselves, <hi>viz.</hi> exercising a coercive power or jurisdiction over the consciences of men in divine concernments: And that the Laws yet in force, unrepealed, by which many of the Lords people have suffered, and more have been exposed thereunto, may speedily be repealed.</p>
               <closer>All which our complaints and Petitions before mentioned, we humbly pray your Honours to lay to heart; and that you will <hi>up and be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in the faithful discharge of your duty: And in so doing, we doubt not but the Lord will be with you; and our hearty prayers shall be continued to the Lord for a blessing upon you; and shall labour (through grace) to be
